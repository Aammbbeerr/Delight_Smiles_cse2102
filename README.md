# Problem Statement
Shavannie, the manager of the dental department, from the Leonora Diagnostic Centre, has found it very tedious to record and keep track of her patient’s required information. She is currently using manual books to document information needed such as: The Name, Age, Date of entry and Address. She also has to record the teeth number and the number of anesthetics used on the patient’s teeth. This method was working for the past year, however, as more patients are being assigned to the dental department, the performance rate has dropped significantly. It is becoming more time-consuming for her to access, edit and even record the patients’ information. Also, the information can be easily breached and used by whoever gets their hands on the book.
She would like a system to be implemented so that she can systematically record the patients’ information within a database and also keep the information safe. This database should allow them to access, record and process the given information faster so that it would be less time consuming. Sakuran Hirman, a database manager has been assigned the task to create this database.
